{"name":"QtDropbox","tagline":"Dropbox API for Qt","body":"# Want to access a Dropbox from Qt?\r\nQtDropbox provides an easy to use API that wraps the common REST API of [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) in convenient C++ classes and objects for [Qt](http://www.qt-project.org). You don't have to worry about creating and calling any HTTP requests that are used to by oAuth and the Dropbox API - all of these calls are wrapped inside the Qt C++ API of QtDropbox!\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nEverything you nedd to use QtDropbox is provided by Qt itself or this library - there are no additional dependencies. QtDropbox relies on the QtNetwork and QtXml modules.\r\n\r\n## Including QtDropbox into your project\r\nIt is fairly easy to use QtDropbox in your own project. There are two tested and supported ways to include QtDropbox. As the project grows other usage methods will follow.\r\n\r\n### As dynamic library\r\nBuild the project by using `qmake` and `make` (or any other commands you usually use). Create a folder called qtdropbox. Copy the libqtdropbox.pri file and all header files into that folder. Now copy that folder (and the library as needed) to your project directory. In your project file (.pro) you only need to add this line:\r\n\r\n`include(\"qtdropbox/libqtdropbox.pri\")`\r\n\r\nAs the project continues some scripts and improvements will be provided to provide some degree of automation for this method.\r\n\r\n### Use the source!\r\nInclude the whole `src` directory in your project and compile the library with your code. It is necessary to add the Qt modules `network` and `xml` to use this method.\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nQtDropbox is constantly improved and developed further to include all possible requests you could\r\nsend to Dropbox and to simplify access. Below is a list of features that are currently available and\r\ntested:\r\n\r\nCurrently in progress:\r\n* Complete documentation\r\n* Examples\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n### General\r\n* Connect to Dropbox\r\n* Access user account information (quotas, user name, share links, ...)\r\n* Parse JSON strings\r\n\r\n### File Access\r\n* Access files like a local QFile to read and write data\r\n* Access file and directory metadata\r\n* Access file revisions\r\n* Reading file information and metadata\r\n\r\nPostponed to next version:\r\n* Acessing and traversing the directory structure\r\n\r\n## Different Qt versions\r\nThe project is targetting the most recent version of Qt and thus was ported to Qt5. In the\r\nbeginning the project was developed for Qt4 and as there are some projects based on Qt4 \r\nout there the legacy version is still being supported.\r\n\r\nThe master branch always provides the most recent version of the project and at the moment\r\nthis is the Qt5 version.\r\n\r\n### Checking out legacy versions\r\nLegacy versions such as the one supporting Qt4 are provided in specific branches. Here is a\r\nshort list which branch to check out for the specific legacy versions:\r\n\r\n* Qt4.x -> qt4\r\n\r\nMind that the branch with name `qt5` is currently an unused stub!\r\n\r\n### Support for legacy versions\r\nThe ongoing development focues on the `master` branch first. This means that legacy versions \r\nare usually not further improved with new features. Bugfixes will be provided though!\r\n\r\nThis should not indicate that legacy versions won't receive important new features but they \r\nare rather implemented on request only. If there is a specific feature that is already \r\nimplemented in the most recent version but you need it in a legacy version (e.g. Qt4.x) \r\njust open an issue.\r\n\r\n# Support us!\r\nBecause QtDropbox is still in development I am glad about every helping hand on the project. If you know a bit about Qt, C++ and the Dropbox REST API you can be a valuable member of this project. Because there is currently only one person maintaining QtDropbox I support two ways of contributing:\r\n\r\n1.  _(Prefered)_ Contact me by mailing to `qtdropbox dot deder dot at`. Add `[QtDropbox]` to the subject of your mail. It doesn't matter if you've got a question, a patch or if you want to join the project as active developer.\r\n2.  Open a new [issue](https://github.com/lycis/QtDropbox/issues) and add a patch if you have a solution for the bug.\r\n\r\nI will look into any questions (and try to answer them in time) as well as I will look into any patches I receive.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [development guidelines](https://github.com/lycis/QtDropbox/blob/master/doc/DEVELOPMENT.md) if you wish to contribute!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
